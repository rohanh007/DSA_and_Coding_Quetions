# Understanding Arrays in C++

This code provides a basic understanding of arrays in C++. It demonstrates array declaration, initialization, accessing elements, and function parameter passing.

## Overview

- `main.cpp`: Contains the main code demonstrating various aspects of arrays in C++.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an explanation of the code and its concepts.

## Key Concepts

### Array Declaration and Initialization

- Arrays in C++ are declared with a fixed size, which must be known at compile time.
- Elements of the array can be initialized during declaration .
- If fewer initial values are provided than the size of the array, remaining elements are initialized to their default values (0 for numeric types).

### Accessing Array Elements

- Array elements are accessed using square brackets `[]` and the element index.
- Accessing elements beyond the bounds of an array results in undefined behavior.

### Function Parameter Passing

- Arrays can be passed to functions as parameters.
- When passing arrays to functions, the size of the array is typically also passed as a parameter its is the good pratice .

## How to Use the Code

1. Open the file `main.cpp` in any C++ compiler or online compiler.
2. Run the program to see how arrays work!

## Conclusion

This code provides a basic understanding of arrays in C++, covering declaration, initialization, accessing elements, function parameter passing, and array sizes.
